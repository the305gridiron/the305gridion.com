# The 305 Gridiron
Welcome to The 305 Gridiron — your home for passionate, hilarious, and brutally honest Miami Dolphins fan takes. We’re not former players. We’re not reporters. We’re just two Dolfans who bleed aqua and orange, and we’ve got opinions you’re gonna want to hear.

Every week we break down the latest news, roster moves, game reactions, draft drama, and everything in between — all with that Miami flavor. Whether we’re hyping up the next breakout star or roasting a 3rd & 12 screen pass, we keep it real, keep it fun, and always keep it Dolphins. Fins up, baby. 🐬🔥

New episodes weekly. Subscribe and ride with us through every win, loss, and wild ride in between.
